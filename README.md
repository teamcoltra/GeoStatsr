## üîç What is GeoStatsr?

GeoStatsr is a local tool to track and analyze your GeoGuessr history, breaking down performance by country, movement mode, game type, and more.

Instead of vague averages, GeoStatsr shows **where you're actually struggling** ‚Äî like constantly confusing Switzerland with Slovenia, even if your Europe average looks solid.

## üß© Running GeoStatsr

Once installed, GeoStatsr runs as a background service.

To control it manually:

```bash
# Install the service
./geostatsr -s install

# Start or stop the service
./geostatsr -s start
./geostatsr -s stop

# Restart or uninstall
./geostatsr -s restart
./geostatsr -s uninstall
```

### üì¶ Standalone Mode

Prefer running it directly?

```bash
./geostatsr             # Use default config
./geostatsr -c config.yaml   # Custom config file
```

GeoStatsr will auto-detect whether it can run as a service or fallback to standalone.

---

## üß† Configuration

On first run, GeoStatsr generates a default config file:

```yaml
ncfa: ""                     # Your GeoGuessr _ncfa cookie
listen_ip: "0.0.0.0"
port: 62826
is_public: false
private_key: "auto-generated"
# debug: true
# log_directory: "/path/to/logs"
```

---

## üç™ Getting Your NCFA Cookie

1. Open your browser's dev tools (F12)
2. Go to [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com) and log in
3. Find the `_ncfa` cookie under geoguessr.com > Storage
4. Add the value to your `config.yaml` or use this:

```http
GET /api/update_ncfa?token=YOUR_NCFA_VALUE
```

---

## üß† Final Notes

Yes, I include platform-specific **prebuilt binaries** directly in this repo.
Why?

* Most users **don‚Äôt build from source**
* This makes installation fast and easy
* No releases tab, no confusion ‚Äî just unzip and run

If you disagree or want an alternate release flow, open an issue ‚Äî I‚Äôm open to ideas.
